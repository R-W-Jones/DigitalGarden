### 1830s 
In the late 1820s and early 1830s, the main mode of transport available was horse and carriage. However, inventors from Hungary, the Netherlands, US, and the UK began creating some of the first electric cars, testing the concept as they went along. It would be some time before more practical solutions would be developed.

This picture depicts how back then, the electric vehicles weren't that much different from the wagons most people were already accustomed to. 
### Late 1800s
In 1884, Thomas Parker, the man responsible for electrifying the London Underground, created the first production electric car in 1884. Shortly after, in 1888, this was followed up by a German engineer, Andreas Flocken, who was responsible for the first 'real' electric car. 

### 90s
William Morrison, an American alchemist created the first successful EV in the US. His vehicle could carry 6 people and reached a top speed of only 14 miles per hour, but it helped inspire future research and innovation.
