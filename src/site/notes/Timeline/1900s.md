### Early 1900s
From the break of the century, electric cars gained popularity, as compared to the gas and steam powered vehicles of the time, they were quiet, easy to drive, and didn't emit any smell in the form of pollutants. 
Accounting for nearly 1/3 of transportation on the roads, these new alternatives were especially popular amongst woman and those in urban areas.

With the hopes of capitalising on the new found popularity, Thomas Edison worked on finding ways to improve battery technology. At the same time, Ferdinand Porsche, created the worlds first hybrid car. 

### 30s
The improving road infrastructure and cheap, accessible petrol contributed towards a decline in electric vehicles as they were also limited to city use due to their low range and speeds. Ford's Model T was selling incredibly well and by 1935 electric cars had been phased out.

Petrol stations popping up in rural areas only accelerated the decline in the EVs of the time. How different things could be today if a different infrastructure was expanded to make electric vehicles feasible back then? 

### 60s and 70s 
Throughout this period, gas prices soared. The previously cheap and abundant fuel created little need for exploring alternative fuel possibilities. However, as prices soared, interest rose in electric vehicles again although range and performance was still a major drawback and they struggled to compete with gasoline engine powered cars. 
NASA boosted the profile of electric vehicles in 1971 with the lunar rover. This was the first manned vehicle to drive on the moon and was fully electric powered.

### 90s 
In the 1990s, a drive for better fuel efficiency, and low emission vehicles led car manufacturers back to developing electric models in response to this shift in consumer demand. 
Companies like Sony saw the business opportunity in lithium-ion batteries and drove the development of them forward leading to electric vehicles capable of going greater distances. 
The General Motors EV1 or the 'GM EV1' for short is an electric car designed from the ground up which quickly gained itself a cult following after its market debut.
