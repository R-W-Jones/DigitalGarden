In the rapidly evolving landscape of the electric vehicle (EV) industry, the principles of circular economy are gaining traction as essential components of sustainable development. Circular economy initiatives not only aim to minimise waste, maximise resource efficiency, and promote the reuse and recycling of materials from within the EV ecosystem. 
By adopting circular economy practices, stakeholders in the EV industry can mitigate concerns for environmental impact, drive innovation, and create long-term value for society. 
This hub note serves as a gateway to deeper explore key circular economy initiatives shaping the future of the electronic vehicle industry. 

### Explore the following circular economy initiatives: 
- [[Emerging Trends and Future Outlook/Circular Economy Initiatives/Closed-Loop Recycling\|Closed-Loop Recycling]]
	Closed-loop recycling systems aim to minimise waste by collecting, processing, and reusing materials from end-of-life electric vehicle batteries. Learn more about the innovative recycling technologies and processes driving the transition towards a closed loop supply chain. 
- [[Emerging Trends and Future Outlook/Circular Economy Initiatives/Material Traceability\|Material Traceability]]
	Material traceability systems enhance transparency and accountability in the EV industry supply chain by tracking materials from extraction through to end-of-life disposal. Discover how material traceability promotes responsible sourcing, recycling, and circularity within the electronic vehicle industry. 
- [[Emerging Trends and Future Outlook/Circular Economy Initiatives/Second-Life Battery Applications\|Second-Life Battery Applications]]
	Retired electric vehicle batteries have the potential for second-life applications, such as energy storage systems for renewable energy integration. Explore innovative projects and business models leveraging second-life battery technologies to extend battery lifespan and reduce waste.
