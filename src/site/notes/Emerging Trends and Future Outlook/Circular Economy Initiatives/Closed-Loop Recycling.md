Closed-loop recycling is a critical aspect of sustainable resource management within the electric vehicle (EV) industry. This process involves collecting, processing, and reusing materials from end-of-life vehicle batteries to minimise waste and maximise resource efficiency. 
By adopting closed-loop recycling practices, stakeholders in the ecosystem can mitigate environmental impact, reduce reliance on raw materials, and promote circularity in the battery supply chain.
