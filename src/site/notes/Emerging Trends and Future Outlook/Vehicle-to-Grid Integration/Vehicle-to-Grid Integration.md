Explore the innovative concept of Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) integration, which leverages electric vehicles (EVs) to enhance grid stability, enable energy trading, and facilitate bidirectional charging. Discover how V2G integration intersects with the sociotechnical landscape, addressing energy sustainability and transportation challenges.

### Overview

Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) integration represents a paradigm shift in the relationship between electric vehicles (EVs) and the power grid. By enabling bidirectional energy flow between EVs and the grid, V2G technology offers numerous benefits, including grid stabilisation, peak load management, and renewable energy integration.

### Key Subtopics

- **[[Emerging Trends and Future Outlook/Vehicle-to-Grid Integration/Grid Stability\|Grid Stability]]:** Explore how V2G integration enhances grid stability by utilising EV batteries as grid storage units, providing ancillary services such as frequency regulation and voltage support.
- **[[Emerging Trends and Future Outlook/Vehicle-to-Grid Integration/Energy Trading\|Energy Trading]]:** Delve into the concept of energy trading enabled by V2G technology, allowing EV owners to sell surplus energy stored in their vehicle batteries back to the grid or other consumers.
- **[[Emerging Trends and Future Outlook/Vehicle-to-Grid Integration/Bidirectional Charging\|Bidirectional Charging]]:** Learn about bidirectional charging infrastructure, which enables EVs to not only receive energy from the grid but also inject energy back into the grid during peak demand or when renewable energy generation exceeds consumption.
