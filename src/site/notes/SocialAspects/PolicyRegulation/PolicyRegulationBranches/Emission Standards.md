Emission standards are crucial regulations set by governments to limit vehicle emissions, including greenhouse gases and other pollutants. These standards incentivise automakers to produce cleaner vehicles and drive technological advancements in electric and low-emission vehicles.

### Key Regulations:

- **Vehicle Emission Limits:**
    - Governments enforce limits on vehicle emissions to reduce air pollution and mitigate climate change, encouraging the adoption of cleaner transportation options.
- **Zero-Emission Vehicle Mandates:**
    - Mandates require automakers to sell a percentage of electric or zero-emission vehicles within their fleets, accelerating the transition to electric mobility and reducing emissions.

### Conclusion:

Emission standards are essential for reducing vehicle emissions and promoting cleaner transportation. By enforcing limits and implementing mandates, governments can drive innovation and advance the adoption of electric and low-emission vehicles.
