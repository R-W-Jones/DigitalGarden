Public transport infrastructure is crucial for sustainable mobility, providing convenient, accessible, and environmentally friendly transportation options by taking cars off the road otherwise. Investments in transit networks and electrification efforts are key to reducing reliance on private vehicles and mitigating climate change.

### Key Initiatives:

- **Expansion of Public Transport Networks:**
    - Rail and bus transport offer efficient mass transit options, reducing congestion and emissions for all. 
- **Electrification of Bus and Rail:**
    - Transitioning to electric buses improves air quality and reduces noise pollution in urban areas. The same applies for trains. 

### Integration with Electric Mobility:

- **Intermodal Connectivity:**
    - Last-mile solutions and transport oriented developments enhance accessibility and support shifts towards public transportation methods.

### Conclusion:

Investments in public transport infrastructure are essential for creating sustainable, liveable cities. By expanding transit networks and integrating with electric mobility solutions, governments can promote cleaner and more efficient transportation systems.
