## Planned Obsolescence

Planned obsolescence has been a topic on the rise lately within the wider tech space and the introduction of right to repair regulation being introduced across Europe and the US. This was seen as a great outcome for sustainability campaigners and a win for consumers. 

**Limited Component Availability:**
As vehicles become increasingly complex, consumers are found with less places to provide support and repair as service providers require to have undergone additional training courses. 

**Design Refresh Cycles:**
EV manufacturers implement design cycles, similar with other automakers and tech products. This incentivises regular upgrades due to the craze simulated for the latest and greatest features. 

**Warranties:**
Limited warranties have limitations on time and miles drive usually. Owners are incentivised to upgrade and consider newer models when maintenance costs begin to rise or their warranty expires. 

**Infrastructure Changes:**
Although mostly standardised and with the existence of adaptors, some EVs might be left behind as newer charging methods and technologies are developed.

In a recent news article the BBC reported that owners of older 'Leaf' models will find themselves unable to access certain features within the app from now on. This lead to a realisation for many that this too could happen to them with other makes and models and there have been calls for manufacturers to be obliged to support their vehicles software for their entire lifetime, especially as they become increasingly tech dependent.
